#String methods
course='Python for Beginners'
print(len(course))#this is the len function
print(course.upper())#now upper() is what we call a method because it points to an object which is in this case course
#just try typing course. and see what pycharm brings out
#NB:upper() method does not change the string but, what it does is to collect and then change it to uppercase and send it
#back the way it is to check it we are going to print course again
print(course)
#the other is lower() method which brings out everything in lowercase e.g
print(course.lower())
